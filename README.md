## 📐 **System Design**
### High-Level Architecture
The system is built using a **microservices architecture** for modularity and scalability. Each core feature (e.g., order management, transaction history) is handled by separate controllers for better maintainability. The **MVC framework** ensures a structured separation of concerns:
- **Model:** Handles business logic and database interactions.
- **View:** Presents data to users via dynamic and responsive UI.
- **Controller:** Acts as the bridge between the view and model.
